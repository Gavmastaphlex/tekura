				<h3 class="anchor" id="about-ncea">About NCEA</h3>

				<h4>What is NCEA?</h4>

				<p>The National Certificate in Educational Achievement (NCEA) is New Zealand&rsquo;s national qualification for senior high school students. There are three levels of NCEA and in general, students work through levels 1 to 3 in years 11 to 13. Students are awarded credits towards an NCEA from individual unit and achievement standards. </p>

				<p>High achievement is also recognised at each level by gaining an NCEA with merit or NCEA with excellence (certificate endorsement) as well as recognition for high achievement in an individual course (course endorsement). </p>

				<p>Further information can be found in the Student Guide to National Certificates, Understanding NCEA and NCEA &ndash; steps to success. NZQA also offers a free mobile app called NCEA Guide. This app is free to download from the Apple App store and Google Play store.</p>

				<h3 class="anchor" id="nzqa-student">NZQA student login page</h3>

				<h4>What is an NSN?</h4>

				<p>Te Kura students are identified on our student database with a Te Kura student ID. Students will also have a number to identify them with NZQA. This is called a National Student Number (NSN). If you do not know your NSN, contact your learning advisor or subject teacher.</p>

				<h4>Where can I see my internal results?</h4>

				<p>Our <a href="supervisors_Student-reports.html">online student reports portal</a> shows the NCEA credits you&rsquo;ve earned from any internal and external assessments with Te Kura.</p>

				<p>Internally assessed results are updated on your NZQA student login page  at the beginning and middle of each month from April until the end of November. You should keep checking your NZQA student login page throughout the year to ensure all your internally assessed results have gone to NZQA. </p>

				<h4>What about exam results?</h4>

				<p>Externally assessed results will be available to you in your NZQA student login page from mid-January. </p>

				<h4>How do I find out if I have passed my NCEA?</h4>

				<p>From mid-January, you are expected to check your NZQA student login page to view your results, including your exam results, and the award of any qualifications. </p> 

				<h4>How can I get a copy of my NCEA or Record of Achievement?</h4>

				<p>You can order a paper copy of an NCEA or Record of Achievement through your NZQA student login page. The first copy is free and subsequent copies cost $15.30.</p>

				<h3 class="anchor" id="standards">Standards</h3>

				<h4>What are standards?</h4>

				<p>Standards are the building blocks of national certificates. The standard tells you what to aim for, how well you have to write or speak or do research to gain credits. </p>

				<p>There are two kinds of standards &ndash; unit standards and achievement standards. They both count towards national certificates, including NCEA. Unit standards are always internally assessed and you will usually be awarded either:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Achieved (A) or</li>
					<li>Not Achieved (N).</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Some achievement standards are internally assessed and some are externally assessed.  When you attempt an achievement standard, you will be awarded:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Not Achieved (N)</li>
					<li>Achieved (A)</li>
					<li>Achieved with Merit (M) or</li>
					<li>Achieved with Excellence (E).</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="anchor" id="internally-assessed">Internally assessed results</h3>

				<h4>What does internally assessed mean?</h4>

				<p>Te Kura students complete internal assessments at home throughout the year. These assessments are marked by your Te Kura teachers. Results from your internal assessments are sent to NZQA twice a month during the year from April until the end of November.</p>

				<h4>I don&rsquo;t agree with my internal result. What can I do?</h4>

				<p>If you believe you have been given an inappropriate grade for an internal assessment, you should in the first instance, request that your subject teacher review the marking of the assessment. If the grade remains unchanged and you are still not satisfied with the explanation given by your teacher, you have one month (from the time you received the marked work back from your teacher) to make a formal appeal. The appeal must be made in writing to the Appeals Committee and addressed to the Principal&rsquo;s Nominee at Te Kura. A Student Assessment Appeal form is available on our website.</p>

				<h3 class="anchor" id="externally-assessed">Externally aAssessed sStandards</h3>

				<h4>What does externally assessed mean?</h4>

				<p>Externally assessed standards include NZQA-assessed end of year exams sat during November/December; submission of a portfolio of work for Digital Technology, Design and Visual Communication, Technology, Visual Arts; the Maths Common Assessment Task (MCAT) sat in September; New Zealand Scholarship exams for high achieving Level 3 students and Te Kura overseas exams for eligible students. </p>

				<h4>Do I have to sit end of year exams?</h4>

				<p>It really depends on your goals for NCEA and if you want to be eligible for course endorsement.  Have a chat with your learning advisor to see what&rsquo;s best for you.</p>

				<h4>I want to sit exams. What do I need to do?</h4>

				<p>Te Kura offers personalised learning so we do not automatically register our students for externally assessed standards. If you are enrolled in courses that offer externally assessed standards, you need to select the appropriate standards in the NCEA registration tool on our website. NCEA payment and registration instructions are distributed annually to students from June.</p>

				<h4>Where do I sit end of year exams?</h4>

				<p>Because Te Kura is not an exam centre school, end of year exams must be sat with other students at a secondary school (exam centre school) in your local community. Instructions are included in the NCEA payment and registration information sent annually to students from June.</p>

				<h4>Can I sit exams if I live overseas?</h4>

				<p>Overseas exams are available to full-time Te Kura students living overseas (this does not apply to students living in the Cook Islands or Niue). Full-time means you must be specified as a full-time student on our roll (i.e. adults are not full-time students).  If you are enrolled with Te Kura as a fee-paying student living overseas, full-time means you are enrolled in at least three NCEA courses.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>If you are not full-time, you will need to return to New Zealand to sit the exams at a New Zealand secondary school in November/December.</li>
					<li>New Zealand Scholarship exams are not available to sit overseas.</li>
					<li>Overseas exams are held in October so are held much earlier than the exams in New Zealand and there are no practice exams available.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Does Te Kura have practice exams?</h4>

				<p>Practice exams are available in term 3 if you register for end of year exams (they are not available for portfolio externally assessed standards, the Maths Common Assessment Task, or for students sitting our exams overseas). Practice exams are sat at home in September under strict supervision.</p>

				<p>Practice exams are important not only for feedback about your progress but also if you wish to apply for a derived grade.</p>

				<h4>What if I get sick at exam time?</h4>

				<p>Derived grades are available to students who are registered for externally assessed standards and, for an approved reason, are unable to attend an NZQA end of year exam session, or the Maths Common Assessment Task, or whose performance is impaired in preparing for, or during, an exam session. Contact Jo Parmenter on 0800 65 99 88 ext 8850 for an application.</p>

				<h4>How do I get an Exam Admission slip?</h4>

				<p>If you register for end of year exams you should expect to receive an Exam Admission slip by the beginning of November.  You will need to take this, together with photo ID (student ID, driver&rsquo;s licence, passport) to each of your end of year exams.  If you do not have photo ID, you must organise this well before your exams start. You can <a href="information-for-new-students_Student-ID-card.html" target="_blank">download the application form</a> on our website.</p>

				<h3 class="anchor" id="ncea-registration">NCEA registration</h3>

				<h4>How do I register my NCEA credits?</h4>

				<p>Te Kura students enrolled in NCEA courses are required to complete an online NCEA registration as well as pay the annual NCEA fee. This applies to students completing internal assessments as well as those who wish to register for externally assessed standards. NCEA payment and registration instructions are distributed to students annually from June.</p>

				<h4>What if I need my results early for university or similar?</h4>

				<p>If you are applying to university for semester two, or you need your current year&rsquo;s results earlier than January next year for something like an army or an ETCO application, contact the Qualifications Team as soon as possible.</p>

				<p>Te Kura will need to make a special request to NZQA for the early release of your results. The early release process can take up to three weeks.</p>

				<p>If we make this special request to NZQA, you cannot continue to gain additional credits with us during the rest of the year and must withdraw from our roll.</p>

				<h3 class="anchor" id="ncea-fee">NCEA fee</h3>

				<h4>What are NCEA fees?</h4>

				<p>If you are studying NCEA courses, you will be attempting standards and gaining credits from those standards. The NCEA fee must be paid to have these credits included on your Record of Achievement and count towards your qualifications. This includes all levels of NCEA, University Entrance and other national certificates.</p>

				<h4>What does the fee pay for?</h4>

				<p>This annual fee pays for any NCEA credits you are awarded in a single school year. It is not an exam fee so if you are completing just internal assessments you must still pay to have your credits recorded on your Record of Achievement. You will also be entitled to one free copy of your awarded certificates, your Record of Achievement and, once you have left school, a School Results Summary.</p>

				<h4>What is a Record of Achievement?</h4>

				<p>A Record of Achievement is an official transcript of all the (paid) results you have achieved together with any qualifications. A Record of Achievement will also show endorsements for an NCEA certificate or an individual course. It does not include &lsquo;Not Achieved&rsquo; results.</p>

				<h4>When do I pay the fee?</h4>

				<p>Instructions for NCEA payment and registration are distributed annually to our NCEA students from June. If you enrol after June, you will receive these instructions shortly after your enrolment has been processed.</p>

				<h4>Who do I pay the fee to?</h4>

				<p>As your school, we will collect the fee for the current year&rsquo;s credits on behalf of NZQA. NCEA payment and registration instructions are distributed annually to students from June.</p>

				<h4>How do I pay?</h4>

				<p>Payment can be made either by credit card online or by bank deposit (full instructions are included in the NCEA payment and registration information distributed annually to students from June).</p>

				<p>If you have been enrolled at another secondary school this year and have already paid your NCEA fee to that school, you will not need to pay again but you must still complete an online NCEA registration to reinstate your entry with NZQA.</p>

				<h4>How much does it cost?</h4>

				<p>The annual fee is $76.70 unless you are entitled to apply for financial assistance.</p> 

				<h4>What is financial assistance?</h4>

				<p>Financial assistance is available to reduce the NCEA fee from $76.70 to $20 for a single student. An annual application form is automatically sent to our NCEA students from June every year. </p>

				<h4>Who can apply for financial assistance?</h4>

				<p>The person paying the NCEA fee must be receiving a Work and Income or Study Link benefit, or have a Community Services Card (or have a joint family income that would entitle them to receive a Community Services Card), or have more than one child undertaking secondary school qualifications in a single school year (irrespective of income) and the total fee for that year is higher than $200. </p>


				<ul>
					<li>Income thresholds for entitlement to a Community Services Card become available on the <a href="http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/products/a-z-benefits/community-services-card.html" target="_blank">Work and Income website</a> from 1 April each year. These thresholds are detailed on the Financial Assistance application form.</li>
					<li>International fee-paying students cannot apply for financial assistance.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>How can I apply for financial assistance?</h4>

				<p>Students enrolled in NCEA courses are automatically sent a Financial Assistance application form for the current year as part of the Payment and Registration process. If you lose the application form, <a href="files/2016-Financial-Assistance-Application-form.pdf" target="_blank">download a replacement form</a>.</p>

				<h4>I don&rsquo;t want to sit exams. Do I still have to pay the fee?</h4>

				<p>Yes because the NCEA fee is not an exam fee. Only credits that have been paid for will transfer into your Record of Achievement and count towards your qualification/s.</p>

				<h4>What happens if I don&rsquo;t pay the fee?</h4>

				<p>While you will be able to see your NCEA results in the reports portal, you will need to pay the NCEA fee for them to appear on your NZQA Record of Achievement. You will need to pay an NCEA fee in each year you gain credits to avoid an additional late payment fee charged by NZQA.</p>

				<h4>How can I pay my outstanding NCEA fee?</h4>

				<p>Unpaid NCEA fees for credits gained in previous years must be paid directly to NZQA via the NZQA student login page.</p>

				<h4>I am a junior student in Year 10 or below studying NCEA courses. Do I have to register and pay?</h4>

				<p>Yes. If you are completing internal assessments only while a junior student, Te Kura will keep your credits until you are in Year 11. This means you do not have to pay or register your credits until you are in Year 11 unless you choose to.</p>

				<p>However, if you are registering for any externally assessed standards, you must complete an online NCEA registration and pay the NCEA fee. Externally assessed standards include end of year exams, the Maths Common Assessment Task for AS91027 and portfolio submissions for Digital Technology, Design &amp; Visual Communication, Technology and Visual Arts.</p>

				<h4>I am enrolled at another secondary school but studying some NCEA courses with Te Kura. Do I have to register and pay Te Kura?</h4>

				<p>No. Your NCEA payment will be collected by your own school and it will be their responsibility to also register your Te Kura internal results and externally assessed entries with NZQA. </p>

				<h4>I was enrolled at another secondary school earlier this year. Do I need to register again and pay the fee?</h4>

				<p>Internally assessed results awarded to you by your previous school this year and any externally assessed standards registration will be withdrawn at NZQA. This means you must complete a Te Kura online NCEA registration to reactivate your registration with NZQA.</p>

				<p>If you have already paid your current year&rsquo;s NCEA fee to your school earlier in the year, you can select this option in the online NCEA registration.</p>
