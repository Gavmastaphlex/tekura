				<h2 class="student-zone-sub-color">NCEA fee</h2>

				<h3>What are NCEA fees?</h3>

				<p>If you enter for NCEA, you will be attempting standards and gaining credits from those standards. The NCEA fee must be paid to have these credits included on your Record of Achievement and count towards your qualifications. This includes all levels of NCEA, University Entrance and other national certificates.</p>

				<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>

				<p>The annual fee is $76.70 unless you are entitled to apply for financial assistance.</p> 

				<h3>What does the fee pay for?</h3>

				<p>This annual fee pays for any NCEA credits you are awarded in a single school year. It is not an exam fee so if you are completing just internal assessments you must still pay to have your credits recorded on your Record of Achievement. You will also be entitled to one free copy of your awarded certificates, your Record of Achievement and, once you have left school, a School Results Summary.</p>

				<h3>What is a Record of Achievement?</h3>

				<p>A Record of Achievement is an official transcript of all the (paid) results you have achieved together with any qualifications. A Record of Achievement will also show endorsements for an NCEA certificate or an individual course. It does not include &lsquo;Not Achieved&rsquo; results.</p>

				<h3>When do I pay the fee?</h3>

				<p>Instructions for NCEA payment and registration are given annually to our NCEA students from June. If you enrol after June, you will receive these instructions shortly after your enrolment has been processed.</p>

				<h3>Who do I pay the fee to?</h3>

				<p>As your school, we will collect the fee for the current year&rsquo;s credits on behalf of NZQA. NCEA payment and registration instructions are sent annually to students from June. Dual students&rsquo; fees are paid through their enrolling school.</p>

				<h3>How do I pay?</h3>

				<p>Payment can be made either by credit card online or by bank deposit (full instructions are included in the NCEA payment and registration information given annually to students from June).</p>

				<p>If you have been enrolled at another secondary school this year and have already paid your NCEA fee to that school, you will not need to pay again but you must still complete an online NCEA registration to reinstate your entry with NZQA.</p>

				<h3>What is financial assistance?</h3>

				<p>Financial assistance is available to reduce the NCEA fee from $76.70 to $20 for a single student. An annual application form is automatically given to our NCEA students from June every year.</p> 

				<h3>Who can apply for financial assistance?</h3>

				<p>The person paying the NCEA fee must be receiving a Work and Income or Study Link benefit, or have a Community Services Card (or have a joint family income that would entitle them to receive a Community Services Card), or have more than one child undertaking secondary school qualifications in a single school year (irrespective of income) and the total fee for that year is higher than $200.</p>

				<li>Income thresholds for entitlement to a Community Services Card become available on the WINZ website from 1 April each year. These thresholds are detailed on the Financial Assistance application form given to our NCEA students.</li>
				<li>International fee paying students cannot apply for financial assistance.</li>

				<h3>How can I apply for financial assistance?</h3>

				<p>Students enrolled in NCEA courses are automatically given a Financial Assistance application form for the current year as part of the Payment and Registration process. If you lose the application form, download a <a href="get-ncea-payment-and-registration.html" target="_blank">replacement form</a><span>[TBC]</span>.</p>

				<h3>I don&rsquo;t want to sit exams. Do I still have to pay the fee?</h3>

				<p>Yes, because the NCEA fee is not an exam fee. Only credits that have been paid for will transfer into your Record of Achievement and count towards your qualification/s.</p>

				<h3>What happens if I don&rsquo;t pay the fee?</h3>

				<p>While you will be able to see your NCEA results in the reports portal, you will need to pay the NCEA fee for them to appear on your NZQA Record of Achievement. You will need to pay an NCEA fee in each year you gain credits to avoid an additional late payment fee charged by NZQA.</p>

				<h3>How can I pay my outstanding NCEA fee?</h3>

				<p>Unpaid NCEA fees for credits gained in previous years must be paid directly to NZQA via the <a href="https://secure.nzqa.govt.nz/for-learners/records/login.do" target="_blank">NZQA student login page</a>.</p>

				<h3>I am a junior student in Year 10 or below studying NCEA courses. Do I have to register and pay?</h3>

				<p>Yes. If you are completing internal assessments only while a junior student, Te Kura will keep your credits until you are in Year 11. This means you do not have to pay or register your credits until you are in Year 11 unless you choose to.</p>

				<p>However, if you are registering for any externally assessed standards, you must complete an online NCEA registration and pay the NCEA fee. Externally assessed standards include end of year exams, the Maths Common Assessment Task for AS91027 and portfolio submissions for Digital Technology, Design & Visual Communication, Technology and Visual Arts.</p>

				<h3>I am enrolled at another secondary school but studying some NCEA courses with Te Kura. Do I have to register and pay Te Kura?</h3>

				<p>No. Your NCEA payment will be collected by your own school and it will be their responsibility to also register your Te Kura internal results and externally assessed entries with NZQA.</p>

				<h3>I was enrolled at another secondary school earlier this year. Do I need to register again and pay the fee?</h3>

				<p>Internally assessed results awarded to you by your previous school this year and any externally assessed standards registration will be withdrawn at NZQA. This means you must complete a Te Kura online NCEA registration to reactivate your registration with NZQA.</p>

				<p>If you have already paid your current year&rsquo;s NCEA fee to your school earlier in the year, you can select this option in the online NCEA registration.</p>
