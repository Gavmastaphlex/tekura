				<h2 class="student-zone-sub-color">Laptop and internet assistance</h2>
				
				<p>Te Kura does not receive additional funding for the provision of devices and connectivity. However, we recognise that families on limited incomes may struggle to meet the additional costs involved and have set aside funding to assist as many students in need as we can.</p>

				<p>If you don&rsquo;t have access to the internet or a suitable device to learn on, you can apply for assistance. Eligible students will receive a second-hand laptop computer and an internet subsidy of $30 per month (or an additional $30 for those in rural areas) during the school year which is paid directly into the applicant&rsquo;s bank account.</p>

				<p>We are unable to support all of our students in this way, so eligibility for a <a href="https://www.workandincome.govt.nz/products/a-z-benefits/community-services-card.html" target="_blank">Community Services Card</a> or receiving a benefit are ways we can easily identify those who are most in need. Community Services Cards are available for low to middle income earners, with annual income thresholds that start at $49,447 for a family of two. More than 870,000 New Zealanders already hold one.</p>




				<h3>Our requirements</h3>

				<div id="accordian" class="side-menu">

				<h3 class="sideMenuLink">What are the eligibility criteria? <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

					<div class="sideSubMenu">

				<p>Applications will be approved if you meet the following criteria:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>the application is made on behalf of a full-time student or young adult student enrolled in three or more courses</li>
							<li>the student is enrolled in an online 000, NCEA Level 1 or NCEA Level 2 course (check our course selection guide <a href="media/Choice-2017.pdf">Choice</a> if you are unsure whether or not the course is an online 000 course)</li>
							<li>the applicant is a beneficiary or Community Services Card holder and provides their beneficiary or Community Services Card number with their application</li>
							<li>a valid student ID number is provided with the application</li>
							<li>the applicant and student are resident in New Zealand.</li>

					</div>

					<h3 class="sideMenuLink">What can I do if my application doesn&rsquo;t meet the criteria or is declined? <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

					<div class="sideSubMenu">

						<p>In exceptional circumstances Te Kura may approve applications on behalf of students who do not meet the eligibility criteria. You may make an application for assistance by writing to Te Kura&rsquo;s Chief Executive outlining why you are unable to access a suitable device or the internet and why you do not have a Community Services Card or beneficiary number. Please provide as many details as you can, including student name and ID number in <a href="mailto:regan.dooley@tekura.school.nz">an email</a> or send a letter to:</p>

					<h3 class="sideMenuLink">I can&rsquo;t complete the online form because my enrolment application has not been approved yet (meaning a student ID number hasn&rsquo;t been issued yet). What can I do? <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

					<div class="sideSubMenu">
						
						<p>You can download our <a href="#">application form</a> <span class="important">[Where is this PDF?]</span> to fill in and post back to us, or call us on 0800 65 99 88 to request a copy of the form. Your application for assistance will be considered once the enrolment application has been approved.</p>

					</div>


					<h3 class="sideMenuLink">What kind of device is supplied? <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

					<div class="sideSubMenu">

						<p>The devices are re-conditioned laptop computers which have been loaded with Microsoft Windows. Students are allocated an email address which you can use to access free Microsoft software. The email address is the student&rsquo;s firstname.lastname@mytekura.school.nz and the password is their Te Kura student ID number. </p>
				

					</div>


					<h3 class="sideMenuLink">If my application is approved, how long will it take for the laptop to arrive? <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

					<div class="sideSubMenu">
						
						<p>Depending on where you live, it may take five to 10 working days for your device to be delivered. Please note that laptops are delivered by courier and the courier will not leave the laptop at your address if there is nobody home to sign for it.</p>
				

					</div>

					<h3 class="sideMenuLink">What sort of connectivity assistance is provided? <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

					<div class="sideSubMenu">
						
						<p>We provide a subsidy of $30 per month per student to be used towards internet connectivity through your preferred provider. The subsidy is paid directly into the applicant&rsquo;s bank account, so if you are applying for the subsidy please have your bank account information handy. </p>

						<p>Eligible full-time students enrolled under the geographical isolation, geographical inaccessibility and itinerancy gateways may receive a top-up of their internet subsidy of a further $30 due to the higher costs faced by families in rural areas. You can apply for this as part of your application for assistance. Young adult students in rural areas may also apply for the top-up.</p>

					</div>


					<h3 class="sideMenuLink">Will Te Kura contact my preferred service provider to arrange connectivity? <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

					<div class="sideSubMenu">
							
						<p>No. Te Kura will pay the subsidy directly into your bank account. If you have a current broadband provider you do not need to do anything, but if you don&rsquo;t yet have an internet connection to your home you will need to arrange that with your preferred provider.</p>
						
						<p>If you&rsquo;re also applying for a laptop, we recommend that you set up your internet connection as soon as your application is approved.</p>
				

					</div>


					<h3 class="sideMenuLink">What can I do if the internet service providers (ISP) will not give me an account? <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

					<div class="sideSubMenu">

						<p>If, for any commercial reason, ISPs will not give you an account you may apply to Internet@Home for your internet connection. Please note that charges will apply.</p>
				

					</div>


					<h3 class="sideMenuLink">What training or support is provided for the student using the new laptop? <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

					<div class="sideSubMenu">
						
					
						<p>Simple instructions for operating your laptop will be included when it is sent out to you. We recommend <a href="https://www.digitalunite.com/guides/computer-basics">Digital Unite</a> as a great place to learn computer basics. All our students are able to download <a href="information-for-new-students_Assistance-for-students_Free-Microsoft-Office.html">Microsoft Office 365</a> for free.</p>

					</div>

					<h3 class="sideMenuLink">Who should we contact if we have any technical problems with the laptop? <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

					<div class="sideSubMenu">
						
				
						<p>Email our <a href="mailto:lac.assistance@tekura.school.nz">helpdesk</a> or telephone 0800 65 99 88 ext 8500.</p>

					</div>


					<h3 class="sideMenuLink">Can I apply for assistance for more than one student? <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

					<div class="sideSubMenu">

						<p>Yes, providing the other student(s) are enrolled in an online 000, NCEA Level 1 or NCEA Level 2 course and you meet the other eligibility criteria for assistance.</p>

						<p>Families that do not meet the criteria but for exceptional reasons are unable to provide devices and internet access to their student may apply directly to the Chief Executive, who will consider each case on its merits.</p>
				
					</div>



					<h3 class="sideMenuLink">Although not enrolled in an online 000 and/or NCEA Level 1 or NCEA Level 2 course, I/my student is enrolled in an online course at another level &ndash; can I still apply for assistance from Te Kura? <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

					<div class="sideSubMenu">
						
						<p>At this stage our assistance programme is only available for students who are enrolled in an online 000, NCEA Level 1 or NCEA Level 2 course. </p>

					</div>



					<h3 class="sideMenuLink">Are overseas students eligible for assistance? <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

					<div class="sideSubMenu">
						
						<p>No, the student must be living in New Zealand.</p>

					</div>



					<h3 class="sideMenuLink">What happens with the laptop and internet subsidy after leaving Te Kura?  <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

					<div class="sideSubMenu">
						
						<p>The laptop and subsidy are only available while enrolled with Te Kura. When you apply for a subsidy you are required to sign a declaration that you'll let Te Kura know if you/your student is withdrawing from the roll. We will then arrange for the laptop to be returned and the subsidy payments will be cancelled.</p>

					</div>



					<h3 class="sideMenuLink">Are there other options available for families of students who aren't eligible for assistance from Te Kura? <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

					<div class="sideSubMenu">
							
						<p>You may be eligible to participate in the 2020 Communication Trust&rsquo;s Internet@Home equity programme. This programme is intended for low income families who do not have a fixed telephone line and would struggle to pay monthly internet charges in advance, or who may be declined service because of a poor credit record. Families with a fixed telephone line are encouraged to ask their telephone service provider for a bundled phone and internet service.</p>

						<p>For the Internet@Home programme, the 2020 Trust pre-purchases internet access in two 6-month blocks, removing uncertainty about availability or disconnection if a monthly direct debit fails due to insufficient funds. In turn, families must commit to paying an agreed fixed amount each week or fortnight by automatic payment. If payments are missed due to insufficient funds, the family will receive a reminder, and have the opportunity to make catch-up payments. If they continue to miss payments, the second 6-month connection may not be activated. </p>

						<p>Internet@Home includes the following options for families without an active telephone service:</p>

						<ol>
							<li>Naked DSL with 50GB monthly data cap: $10/week for 12 months</li>
							<li>Naked UFB with 50GB monthly data cap: $12/week for 12 months</li>
							<li>Wireless options may also be available in some areas for $12/week for 12 months.</li>
						</ol>

						<p>Families can register their interest in being part of this programme by sending an email with their name and contact details to <a href="mailto:kristina.parbhu@2020.org.nz">kristina.parbhu@2020.org.nz</a> or by calling her on 0800 272 020 between 9am and 3pm weekdays. Participants may be required to attend a half-day internet training session.</p>
				

					</div>



					<h3 class="sideMenuLink">Is there additional support available for rural students? <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

					<div class="sideSubMenu">
							
						<p>Yes. If you have a full-time student enrolled through one of the geographical isolation/itinerancy enrolment gateways you can apply for the internet connectivity top-up of $30 per week. </p>

						<p>Young adult students in rural areas who are not enrolled through these gateways but are otherwise eligible for assistance can also apply for the top-up, providing they meet the same criteria as they would if they had been enrolled through one of the full-time enrolment gateways, i.e:</p>

						<ul><li>the student would be unable to attend a reasonably convenient school because of its distance or inaccessibility from their home. To qualify, the student&rsquo;s nearest school for their age, gender, and in their preference of English or Māori medium, and school bus route and public transport must be:</li></ul>

						<ul>
							<ol>more than 4.8 kilometres away (private road distance does not count)</ol>
							<ol>located behind a geographic barrier preventing reasonable access to a school, suitable public transport or school bus route.</ol>
						</ul>

						<p>To apply for the assistance, email ruralsubsidy@tekura.school.nz (or apply in writing via post if you do not have an email address) outlining how you/your student meets these criteria. This will then be assessed by a team leader or the Manager, Enrolment Services and if eligible the application will be approved and you will be advised of the outcome in writing.</p>

					</div>



					<h3 class="sideMenuLink">Can itinerant students apply for additional support? <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

					<div class="sideSubMenu">
							

						<p>Yes. Full-time students enrolled through the itinerancy gateway are also eligible to receive the internet connectivity rural top-up, providing they meet all other eligibility criteria for laptop and connectivity support.</p>
