				<h2 class="about-us-sub-color">Glossary</h2>

				<p><span class="bold"><a href="http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/about/glossary/e/index.html#a" target="_blank">Achievement Standards</a></span> - Courses at curriculum levels 6 to 8 (usually in years 11 to 13) are assessed against standards. Your work is compared to a fixed standard, not the work of other students. If you do the work required, you achieve that standard. Some achievement standards are assessed internally (marked by your teacher). If you don’t achieve an internally assessed achievement standard the first time you try, you may be able to try again.</p>

				<p>For externally assessed achievement standards, students sit an external exam in November along with others studying the same subject. Students can also earn achievement standards with merit or with excellence. See also <a href="http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/qualifications-standards/standards/" target="_blank">unit standards</a>.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.tekura.school.nz/assets/media/pdf/QUANC-2015-web.pdf" target="_blank">Student Guide to National Certificates</a> gives details on achievement standards, unit standards and NCEA.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Address card</span> - This card has your address on one side and the school's address on the other. When you send work back to Te Kura, make sure the school address is visible through the bag.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Adult student</span> - A student aged 20 or older in the year of study. You must be living in New Zealand and a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident of New Zealand or Australia and not attending another secondary school. Adults can enrol full-time or part-time. Fees are $111 per course.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Assessable work</span> - Assessable work is work you have done in the programmes or courses you are enrolled in. This work can be checked by the teacher and recorded to show progress. Assessable work can be sent to the teacher by post or electronically.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Authentication</span> - Work sent for assessment in qualifications courses may require authentication. The student and/or supervisor needs to sign the cover sheet to confirm that the student did the work without assistance. The cover sheet of a booklet says if authentication is required.</p>


				<p><span class="bold">Booklet</span> - Course material is often broken down into a series of booklets, which each cover different topics or activities. Some booklets provide space for students to write their answers, while others require students to write on their own paper. If the booklet provides space for answers, return the whole booklet when you’ve finished the work. Otherwise, remove the back cover of the booklet and send it in with your own numbered pages attached. Keep the rest of the booklet to use for revision.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Course</span> - A specific programme of learning in a subject at one curriculum level, for example, NCEA level 2 English (EN2000).</p>

				<p><span class="bold"><a href="http://www.tekura.school.nz/enrol-with-us/fees/" target="_blank">Course fees</a></span> - Students who are not eligible to enrol under the Ministry of Education enrolment criteria pay course fees. The amount depends on their citizenship status, where they live and their year level.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Cover sheet</span> - The back cover of course work booklets is the cover sheet. If your booklet provides space on the pages for you to answer questions, return the whole book to your teacher. If you write your answers on your own paper, remove the cover sheet from the booklet and send it back attached to your written work. Remember to number your pages.</p>

				<p><span class="bold"><a href="http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/ncea/for-students/requirements.html" target="_blank">Credits</a></span> - Students who pass unit standards or achievement standards get credits on the National Qualifications Framework. Achieving a certain number of credits is a requirement of NCEA and other National Certificates.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Curriculum</span> - The <a href="http://nzcurriculum.tki.org.nz/" target="_blank">New Zealand Curriculum</a> says what is taught in schools in Years 1 to 13.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Dual students</span> - dual students are enrolled with us by their home school for specific programmes or courses. This means that they attend their local school while studying with us subjects their school is unable to provide. We offer primary dual enrolled students enrichment, acceleration and adaptation and provide te reo Maori and technology tuition. We also offer adapted programmes for students with special education needs.</p>

				<p>We provide secondary programmes to schools in which:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Only a small number of students study the subject</li>
					<li>A broad curriculum cannot be provided because of the small size of school</li>
					<li>No subject teacher is available or,</li>
					<li>A student has transferred and the subject(s) previously taken is not offered.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>At secondary level, our subject teachers will work in partnership with the school and student to develop programmes for dual enrolled students. Students with special education needs can have courses adapted to meet their needs. See our <a href="subjects-and-courses.html" target="_blank">subjects and courses</a> pages for information about what we offer at secondary level. For more information <a href="http://www.tekura.school.nz/contact-us" target="_blank">contact us</a>.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Early childhood education</span> - Eligible early childhood students can start learning with us at three years of age. Most students start school (Year 1) when they reach their fifth birthday, but they are not required to start school until they are six.

				<p><span class="bold">ECH wait list</span> - Children approved by Te Kura as eligible for entry but who are under the age of 3 years old or for whom a vacancy is not immediately available will have their names placed on a waiting list. Wait listed children will normally be admitted to the school in age order.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Early leaving exemption for 15 year olds</span> - The school leaving age in New Zealand is 16 years old.
